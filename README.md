Deeper understanding of REST web services

Ranga's repo is here:  https://github.com/in28minutes/spring-microservices/tree/master/02.restful-web-services

spring-boot-devtools is used which means code changes cause a faster auto-reload (it only reloads my code, not all the unchanged dependencies).  Remember to add the chrome extension RemoteLiveReload if you want it to auto-refresh in the browser (though I've not had much luck with that).
